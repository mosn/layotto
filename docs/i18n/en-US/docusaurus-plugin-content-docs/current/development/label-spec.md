Normative： for new tasks (good first issue)

1. In issue label, issues with "good first issue" labels are considered to be "tasks suitable to newcomers";

2. If no assignee, represent 'ad litem'; if there is a assignnee representative' who already claims ':

3. For task classification:
   issue requires a label "kind/xxxx", where xx represents the task category.

Like "kind/ci" for category "ci" ：

like "kind/demo" for category "demo" ：

4. For task difficulty
   issue requires some labels for hardship, including "easy", "medium", "hard", as follows:

5. When you run an operation, do you write "Task Name" in Chinese or English?

   If the title of the issue is in Chinese, the name of the task will be in Chinese; if there are no Chinese names, an English name

## Events and Tasks Recommendations

1. One or two tasks can be selected for each type of task, such as demo category two, ci challenges one (feel that some less people are thinking about them?)
2. You can select an updated task because old issue may not be attractive if it is unavailable
