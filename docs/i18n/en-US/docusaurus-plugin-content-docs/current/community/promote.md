## Reviewer

### Condition to Reviewer

The issue review and code review of a module, and the PR's contribution to this module satisfies one of the following conditions:\*\*

- 1 Hard Level PR
- 2 Medium Level PR
- 1 Medium+2 Easy-Level PR

Note：equals `Hard:Medium:Easy` to `1:2:4`

The logic of designing this rule is that： Reviewer needs to understand a module before turning it off to it.How can he judge that he knows well?Just see his PR, 1 hard level pr, or 2 medium pr, or 1 medium+2 easy level pr

The design disadvantage：does not include the contribution of the review and does not inspire participants to make a review.Consideration had also been given to including the number of reviews in terms of promotion, but it had been carefully thought out that the statistics were not good and it had been suggested that the discussion should be welcomed.
