# Quick Start

We have provided many Demo for you to quickly run Layotto on your computer and feel its strength.

Before you start, you need to prepare the following environment： on your computer

- Golang 1.14 and above, \*\*or \*\* Java 8, Maven 3

If you are ready, you can tap various Demo in the navigation bar on the left to start our travel!
